title: "Realtime Signup Verification"
description: "Verify emails at signup or lead capture using realtime checks and clear accept/hold/reject rules."
---

## Use Case Summary
Use realtime email verification when a user submits a signup or lead form. This blocks invalid or disposable addresses early, reduces bounce rate, and keeps activation funnels clean.

## Where Verification Fits
Workflow at a glance:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Capture">
    Collect the email at signup or lead form submission.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verify">
    Run realtime verification for the address.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Decide">
    Accept, hold, or reject based on verification signals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Store">
    Save results on the user record for future sends.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Recommended Flow
1. Capture the email address on form submit.
2. Call realtime verification for that email.
3. Apply decision rules based on `status`, `is_disposable`, and `is_role_based`.
4. Store the verification signals with the user record.

## Minimal API Example
```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://api.boltroute.ai/api/v1/verify' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com"}'
```

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "status": "exists",
  "is_role_based": false,
  "is_disposable": false,
  "is_catchall": false,
  "unknown_reason": null
}
```

## Decision Rules
Common policies for signup flows:
- Accept when `status` is `exists` and `is_disposable` is `false`.
- Reject when `status` is `invalid_syntax` or `not_exists`.
- Hold for review or require double opt-in when `status` is `catchall` or `unknown`.
- Optionally flag `is_role_based` addresses for extra review.

## Operational Notes
- Authorization is required for all API requests.
- Treat `408 Request Timeout` as an uncertain result and retry or queue a follow-up check.
- Respect `429` rate limits with exponential backoff.

<Info>
  If the user is waiting on-page, retry once on transient failures, then treat the result as `unknown`.

## Success Metrics
- Lower bounce rate for welcome or activation emails.
- Reduced fake or disposable signups.
- Higher conversion from verified leads to active users.
