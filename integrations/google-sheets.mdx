## What you will build
Use the Bolt Route Google Sheets add-on to connect your API key, verify lists, and import results.

## Step 1: Create your Bolt Route API key
1. Create an account or log in to Bolt Route.
2. Open [app.boltroute.ai/api](https://app.boltroute.ai/api).
3. Click **New key**.
4. In the **Generate API key** dialog, select **Google Sheets** to tag usage. Keys are universal, so the selection only tags usage.
5. Enter a key name, then click **Create key**.
6. Copy the key now. It is shown only once.

## Step 2: Install the Bolt Route add-on
1. Open Google Sheets.
2. Go to **Extensions** -> **Add-ons** -> **Get add-ons**.
3. Search for **Bolt Route** or open the installation link provided by your account team.
4. Click **Install** and grant permissions.
5. Refresh the spreadsheet.

## Step 3: Connect your API key
1. Open **Extensions** -> **Bolt Route** -> **Get Started**.
2. Click **Start setup**.
3. Paste your API key, then click **Test Connection**.
4. Click **Continue**, then **Start Using**.

## Step 4: Verify emails from your sheet
1. Select a column or range that contains emails.
2. Use **Extensions** -> **Bolt Route** -> **Verify Emails**, or open **Extensions** -> **Bolt Route** -> **Home** and click **Verify Emails**.
3. Single-cell selections verify immediately and write results in new columns on the same row.
4. Ranges and full columns create a verification task and write results when the task completes.
5. Lists above 10,000 emails prompt you to confirm a batch upload.

## Step 5: Track batch tasks and import results
1. Open **Extensions** -> **Bolt Route** -> **Batch Verifications**.
2. Review statuses: Processing, Completed, Completed with errors, Failed.
3. Click **Import** to write results to a new sheet, the current sheet at the cursor, or a specific range.
4. Click **Emails** on a task to review per-email results and import selected jobs.

## Step 6: Configure preferences
1. Open **Extensions** -> **Bolt Route** -> **Settings**.
2. Update your API key and preferences like auto-formatting, duplicate handling, default import location, and task refresh interval.
3. Review daily quota usage in the same panel.

## Results columns
Results are written with headers aligned to your selection. If headers are missing, the add-on inserts them above the results. Columns include:
- Email
- Status
- Is Role-Based
- Is Disposable
- Has MX Records
- Domain Name
- Is Catchall
- Validated At
- Has Reverse DNS
- Host Name
- Server Type
- Unknown Reason
- Needs Physical Verify

<Note>
Full-column selections are trimmed to the used rows in the sheet. Duplicate emails are de-duplicated before submission, and results are aligned back to every matching row.
