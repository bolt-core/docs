## What you will build
Create a Make.com scenario using the **Bolt Route - Email Verification** app to verify single emails or submit bulk tasks, then branch on the results.

## Step 1: Create your Bolt Route API key
1. Create an account or log in to Bolt Route.
2. Open [app.boltroute.ai/api](https://app.boltroute.ai/api).
3. Click **New key**.
4. In the **Generate API key** dialog, select **Custom** if it is available. If not, pick any option such as **Zapier**. Keys are universal, so the selection only tags usage.
5. Enter a key name, then click **Create key**.
6. Copy the key now. It is shown only once.

## Step 2: Connect Bolt Route in Make.com
1. In Make.com, create a new scenario or open an existing one.
2. Add a module and search for **Bolt Route - Email Verification**.
3. Click **Add** to create a new connection.
4. Paste your API key and leave the **Base URL** as `https://api.boltroute.ai` unless you use a custom endpoint.
5. Save the connection.

## Step 3: Realtime verification
1. Add the **Verify Email** module.
2. Map **Email** from your trigger.
3. Run the module once to validate the connection.
4. Use fields like `status`, `is_disposable`, and `is_role_based` to filter or branch your scenario.

## Step 4: Bulk verification with a list
1. Build a list of emails using an Array Aggregator or a previous module.
2. Add **Create Verification Task**.
3. Map **Emails** to the array of email strings.
4. Optionally set **Webhook URL** if you want a callback when the task finishes.
5. The response includes a task `id`.
6. Add **Get Task** to check progress, **Get Task Jobs** to inspect per-email results, or **Download Task Results** to fetch a CSV/XLSX file.

## Step 5: Batch uploads with a file
1. Add **Upload Email File** and map a file from your previous step.
2. Supported formats: `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`.
3. For `.csv` or `.xlsx`, set **Email column** to a header name or 1-based index.
4. The response includes `upload_id` and `task_id`.
5. Use **Get Batch Upload Status** to check progress, then **Download Task Results** to retrieve the output file.

<Note>
  **Limits:** Create Verification Task supports up to 10,000 emails. `.txt` uploads do not support `email_column`.
</Note>

## Additional modules you may use
- **Get Credit Balance** and **List Credit Transactions** for credit tracking.
- **Get Verification Metrics** for usage analytics.
- **API Keys** modules to create, list, inspect usage, or revoke keys.

<Note>
  Replace `https://api.boltroute.ai` with your Bolt Route API base URL if different.
