## What you will build
Create a Zap using the **Bolt Route - Email Validation & Verification** app to verify single emails or submit bulk tasks and act on the results.

## Step 1: Create your Bolt Route API key
1. Create an account or log in to Bolt Route.
2. Open [app.boltroute.ai/api](https://app.boltroute.ai/api).
3. Click **New key**.
4. In the **Generate API key** dialog, select **Zapier** to tag usage. Keys are universal, so the selection only tags usage.
5. Enter a key name, then click **Create key**.
6. Copy the key now. It is shown only once.

## Step 2: Connect Bolt Route to Zapier
1. In Zapier, create a new Zap or open an existing one.
2. Add a step and search for **Bolt Route - Email Validation & Verification**.
3. Click **Sign in** and paste your API key when prompted.
4. Name the connection and continue.

## Step 3: Realtime verification in Zapier
1. Add an **Action** step and select **Bolt Route - Email Validation & Verification**.
2. Choose **Verify Single Email**.
3. Map the **Email Address** field from your trigger.
4. Test the step. The output includes `status`, `is_disposable`, and `is_role_based`.

## Step 4: Batch verification in Zapier
1. Add an **Action** step and choose **Create Bulk Verification Task**.
2. Map **Emails** to a list of addresses. Provide one email per line item, up to 10,000.
3. To receive per-email completion results, create a separate Zap with the **Task Completed** trigger and copy the webhook URL shown in that trigger setup.
4. Paste the webhook URL into **Webhook URL** in your bulk task action.
5. Test the step. The response includes a task `id`.

## Step 5: Track progress or results
1. Add the **Find Task by ID** search and map the task `id` to check status, counts, and completion.
2. Or use the **Task Completed** trigger output to update your CRM, spreadsheet, or list as each email finishes.
