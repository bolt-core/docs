## What you will build
Create a Zap that sends email addresses to Bolt Route and returns a verification status you can use to route or update records.

## Step 1: Create your Bolt Route API key
1. Create an account or log in to Bolt Route.
2. Open [app.boltroute.ai/api](https://app.boltroute.ai/api).
3. Click **New key**.
4. In the **Generate API key** dialog, select **Zapier** to tag usage. Keys are universal, so the selection only tags usage.
5. Enter a key name, then click **Create key**.
6. Copy the key now. It is shown only once.

## Step 2: Realtime verification in Zapier
1. Create a new Zap and choose your trigger app.
2. Add an action and select **Webhooks by Zapier**.
3. Choose **Custom Request**.
4. Set **Method** to `POST` and **URL** to `https://api.boltroute.ai/api/v1/verify`.
5. Set **Headers**:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
Content-Type: application/json
```

6. In **Data**, add a field named `email` and map it to the email from your trigger.
7. Test the step. The response includes fields like `status`, `is_disposable`, and `is_role_based`.

## Step 3: Batch verification in Zapier
1. Make sure you have a list of emails available as a line-item array or from a previous step.
2. Add an action and select **Webhooks by Zapier**.
3. Choose **Custom Request**.
4. Set **Method** to `POST` and **URL** to `https://api.boltroute.ai/api/v1/tasks`.
5. Set **Headers**:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
Content-Type: application/json
```

6. In **Data**, send JSON with an `emails` array. Optionally add `webhook_url` to receive a completion callback.

```json
{
  "emails": ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"],
  "webhook_url": "https://example.com/webhook"
}
```

7. The response includes a task `id`. Use it with [Get task](/api-reference/endpoints/batch-verification/get-task) or [Download results](/api-reference/endpoints/batch-verification/download-results).

<Note>
Replace `https://api.boltroute.ai` with your Bolt Route API base URL if different.
