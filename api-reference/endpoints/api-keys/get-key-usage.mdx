title: "Get API key usage"
description: "Retrieve usage data for a single API key."
---

## Overview
Retrieve usage details for a specific API key, including optional daily series when a date range is provided.


## GET /api/v1/api-keys/{id}/usage
Purpose: return usage data for a single API key.

Path parameter:
- `id` (UUID)

Query parameters:
- `from` (RFC3339 timestamp, optional): include daily usage from this timestamp (used for time series). Defaults to key `created_at` when only `to` is provided.
- `to` (RFC3339 timestamp, optional): include daily usage up to this timestamp (used for time series). Defaults to now when only `from` is provided.

Notes:
- Series data is included when either `from` or `to` is provided.
- If `to` is missing, it defaults to now; if `from` is missing, it defaults to the API key `created_at`. The computed bounds are normalized via `normalizeToUTCDate`.
- Daily buckets come from `buildDailySeriesDates`, and the series is generated via `c.buildAPIKeyUsageSeries` using the computed start/end.

Example request:
```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.example.com/api/v1/api-keys/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/usage?from=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&to=2025-01-07T00:00:00Z'
