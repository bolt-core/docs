## Overview
List active API keys for the authenticated user, with optional filtering by last-used timestamps.

## GET /api/v1/api-keys
Purpose: list active API keys for the authenticated user.

Query parameters:
- `from` (RFC3339 timestamp, optional): filter by `last_used_at` >= from
- `to` (RFC3339 timestamp, optional): filter by `last_used_at` less than or equal to `to`
- `reveal` (boolean, optional): include plaintext keys in the response (requires `ENCRYPTION_KEY`)

Notes:
- When `reveal=true`, each key includes a plaintext `key` field.
- Keys are masked by default using `key_preview`.

Example request:
```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.boltroute.ai/api/v1/api-keys'
```
