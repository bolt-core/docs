description: "Revoke an API key."
---

## Overview
- Source: `services/go/app/cmd/controllers/api_key_controller.go`
- Base path: `/api/v1`
- Access: user-scoped; admins can act on behalf of another user via `user_id` (required when the admin token does not map to a user UUID).


## DELETE /api/v1/api-keys/{id}
Purpose: revoke an API key. Admins can revoke any key; non-admins can only revoke their own keys.

Path parameter:
- `id` (UUID)

Example request:
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  'https://api.example.com/api/v1/api-keys/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
```

### Response
Status: `200 OK`

Example response:
```json
{ "message": "API key revoked successfully" }
```

Errors:
- `400` invalid UUID.
- `401` unauthorized.
- `403` forbidden (non-admin attempting to revoke another user key).
- `404` key not found.
- `500` internal error.
