description: "Re-verify dormant lists on a schedule to keep deliverability and reactivation campaigns healthy."

## Use Case
Run recurring email verification to keep long-lived lists clean. This is especially useful before reactivation campaigns or seasonal sends where address quality has decayed.

## Where Verification Fits
Workflow at a glance:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="1. Select">
    Choose dormant or risky segments to re-verify.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Verify">
    Run scheduled batch tasks on the segment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Compare">
    Track shifts in `exists`, `unknown`, and `catchall`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. Suppress">
    Update suppression lists before reactivation.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Recommended Flow
1. Select dormant or high-risk segments (inactive, old, or imported lists).
2. Run a batch verification task on a schedule.
3. Compare results to previous runs to spot decay.
4. Suppress risky segments before reactivation sends.

## Minimal API Example
```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://api.boltroute.ai/api/v1/tasks' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"emails":["user1@example.com","user2@example.com"]}'
```

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "email_count": 2,
  "domain_count": 1
}
```

## Decision Rules
Common hygiene rules:
- Suppress `invalid_syntax` and `not_exists` immediately.
- Review `catchall` and `unknown` before reactivation.
- Suppress `is_disposable` for reputation-sensitive campaigns.

## Operational Notes
- Space re-verification runs to avoid unnecessary credit usage.
- Track list decay by monitoring changes in `exists` versus `unknown` counts.
- Use [Download batch verification results](/api-reference/endpoints/batch-verification/download-results) to keep an audit trail.

<Tip>
  Keep a small baseline segment to measure list decay over time.
</Tip>

## Success Metrics
- Higher delivery rates on reactivation campaigns.
- Fewer bounces over time.
- Cleaner suppression lists and lower send costs.
