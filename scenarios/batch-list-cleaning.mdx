title: "Batch List Cleaning"
description: "Clean large email lists before campaigns or CRM imports using batch verification."
---

## Use Case
Use batch email verification to clean large lists before a campaign, CRM import, or migration. This protects deliverability and keeps your lists focused on reachable inboxes.

## Where Verification Fits
Workflow at a glance:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Export">
    Pull the list from your CRM, ESP, or database.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verify">
    Create a batch task with up to 10,000 emails.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Segment">
    Split results by `status` and risk flags.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Import">
    Load clean segments back into your ESP or CRM.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Recommended Flow
1. Export the list of emails from your CRM or database.
2. Create a batch verification task with up to 10,000 emails.
3. Poll the task status or wait for a webhook notification.
4. Download results and segment the list by `status` and risk flags.
5. Import only acceptable addresses into your next campaign.

## Minimal API Example
```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://api.boltroute.ai/api/v1/tasks' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"emails":["user1@example.com","user2@example.com"]}'
```

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "email_count": 2,
  "domain_count": 1
}
```

## Decision Rules
Common batch segmentation rules:
- Keep `exists` addresses for campaigns.
- Suppress `invalid_syntax` and `not_exists`.
- Review `catchall` and `unknown` before sending.
- Suppress `is_disposable` for most lifecycle or paid campaigns.

## Operational Notes
- Batch processing is asynchronous; use [Get batch verification task](/api-reference/endpoints/batch-verification/get-task) to monitor progress.
- Download results with [Download batch verification results](/api-reference/endpoints/batch-verification/download-results).
- Consider webhooks for large lists to avoid polling.

<Tip>
  If your list is large, use a webhook so your pipeline updates automatically when the task finishes.
</Tip>

## Success Metrics
- Reduced bounce rate and spam complaints.
- Higher delivery and inbox placement.
- Cleaner CRM segments for future outreach.
