description: "Automate verification flows by receiving webhook events and updating downstream tools."

## Use Case
Use webhooks when you want verification to trigger downstream automation without polling. This is ideal for routing results into CRMs, spreadsheets, or internal workflows.

## Where Verification Fits
Workflow at a glance:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="1. Trigger">
    Capture email(s) from a form or app event.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Create task">
    Submit a batch task with a `webhook_url`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Receive">
    Handle per-email or task completion webhooks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. Route">
    Update your CRM, spreadsheet, or workflow.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Recommended Flow
1. Capture one or more emails from a form or app event.
2. Create a batch task and include a `webhook_url`.
3. Receive per-email or task completion webhooks.
4. Map verification signals to actions in your CRM or automation tool.

## Minimal API Example
```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://api.boltroute.ai/api/v1/tasks' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"emails":["user@example.com"],"webhook_url":"https://example.com/webhook"}'
```

Example webhook payload:
```json
{
  "event_type": "email_verification_completed",
  "task_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "completed_at": "2025-01-01T12:01:12Z",
  "data": {
    "job": {
      "email_address": "user@example.com",
      "email": { "status": "exists" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Decision Rules
Common webhook routing rules:
- Reject or suppress when `status` is `invalid_syntax` or `not_exists`.
- Hold for review when `status` is `catchall` or `unknown`.
- Accept or advance a lead when `status` is `exists`.

## Operational Notes
- Webhook URLs must be HTTPS and respond with a `2xx` status.
- Verify signatures when `WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY` is configured.
- Use `X-Webhook-ID` for idempotency if you process retries.

<Info>
  Acknowledge webhooks quickly, then process updates asynchronously to avoid retries.
</Info>

## Success Metrics
- Faster lead routing and reduced manual review.
- Lower operational overhead from polling.
- Consistent verification signals across tools.
